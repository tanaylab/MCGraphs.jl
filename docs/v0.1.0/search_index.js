Both objects need to be internally consistent. This is especially relevant for the graph configuration. When creating UI for filling in these objects, we can in general easily validate each field on its own (e.g., ensure that a \"color\" field contains a valid color name). To ensure the overall object is consistent, we provide overall-type-specific validation functions that can be invoked by the UI to inform the user if the combination of (individually valid) field values is not valid for some reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"validations.html#MCGraphs.Validations.ObjectWithValidation","page":"Validations","title":"MCGraphs.Validations.ObjectWithValidation","text":"A common type for objects that support validation, that is, that one can invoke validate_object on.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"validations.html#MCGraphs.Validations.validate_object","page":"Validations","title":"MCGraphs.Validations.validate_object","text":"validate_object(object::ObjectWithValidation)::Maybe{AbstractString}\n\nValidate all field values of an object are compatible with each other, assuming each one is valid on its own.
